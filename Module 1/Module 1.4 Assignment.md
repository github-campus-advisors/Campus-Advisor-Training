# Module 1.4 Assignment

You were introduced to the tool [Visualizing Git](http://git-school.github.io/visualizing-git/) in this lesson. On your command
line, I would like you replicate this visualization:

This will require you to create a new repository and to do four seperate commits. Note, there is more than one way to replicate 
this visualization on the command line. You are more than welcome to use [Visualizing Git](http://git-school.github.io/visualizing-git/) to help you.

**Hint**
You will have to initialize a new repository, make four commits total, add one new branch, and you will need to
checkout onto the Master branch in the end to ensure `HEAD` is pointing to Master.

Once you have determined the correct sequence of git commands, take a screenshot of your command line
and upload your screenshot to a new Issue titled Module 1.4 Assignment. If your command line is long with commands, 
you are welcome to take multiple screenshots and upload them to the Issue.
