# Module 2.1 Assignment

In this lesson, you learned how to create a remote repository from scratch. But what happens if you want to create a local version of a remote repository that already exists? Now, if a repository already exists, and it already has code that you want, you can actually copy it to your local machine using the command `git clone` followed by the Repository URL.  

In this assignment, you’ll learn how to clone a repository on GitHub to your local machine, allowing you to manage and edit files locally. To complete this assignment, follow the instructions below:

1. Navigate to the main page of this repository on GitHub. Click the green button that says `Code` then copy the URL by clicking the gray clipboard icon.

2. On the command line, type `git clone` along with the URL you copied earlier, then press Enter.  
```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-REPOSITORY.git
```

3. After the repository has successfully cloned to your machine, type `ls` in your terminal to view the newly cloned repository in your machine’s directory.
