# Module 2.1 Assignment

In this assignment you will create a remote on your computer with this repository. In [Module 2.1](https://youtu.be/R2bLo-KiYlU)
you were given an introduction on how to create a remote from scratch, but what happens if you want to create a remote for a
repository that already exists. Now, if a repository already exists, and it already has code that you want, 
you can actually copy it to your local machine using the command `git clone` followed by the Repository URL.

Lets do this step by step:

1. First you need to find the repository URL in the root of the repository. You should see a button that says `Clone or Download`:

Copy the URL and head over to the command line.

2. On the command line you want to type `git clone <YOUR URL>` where you add the URL in the place of `<YOUR URL>`.
You will notice that there is some network activity happening. 

3. Once the network activity finishes, type `ls` and you will notice you have the repository on your local machine. You
can `cd` into the repository and see all the files that are on GitHub are now on your local machine:

Take a screenshot of your command line showing how you cloned this repository onto your local machine. Create an `Issue` with the title `Module 2.1 Assignment` and include the screenshot in the body of the issue.
