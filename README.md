## Work at your own pace
There is no grade for this training and GitHub Education staff does not review your work, so feel free to explore at your own pace. We hope the training will help you get started with GitHub and GitHub Education.

## When you are finished

Once you have completed the training, youâ€™re free to end there with your new knowledge. Or, after you have spent some using GitHub in your classroom, you may want to consider becoming a GitHub Campus Advisor.

GitHub Campus Advisors are a community of educator leaders who champion industry tools in their classroom. As a Campus Advisor, youâ€™ll:
- Join a collaborative network that allows you to learn from your peers, see how theyâ€™re supporting their classrooms, and share your own tips
- Receive professional development support from GitHub
- Be invited to participate in GitHub Education sponsored conferences

A Campus Advisor applicant should:
- Be comfortable using Git and GitHub
- Have had a GitHub account for at least six months
- Be a classroom teacher who teaches students
- Have used GitHub with students in the classroom for at least one semester
- Be verified for [GitHub Education benefits for teachers](https://education.github.com/discount_requests/teacher_application) (which grants you access to the [GitHub Teacher Toolbox](https://education.github.com/toolbox))
