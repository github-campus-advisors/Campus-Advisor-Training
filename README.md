# Welcome to Campus Advisor Training

Welcome to Campus Advisor training. You will be presented with video lessons and asked to complete assignments for each video lesson. All of the videos and assignments can be found in this repository. You are welcome to navigate around this repository, or you are welcome to just follow the links like the one at the bottom of this README to help you progress through the training.

In each module, you will find video lessons marked with this icon :tv: and assignments will be marked with this icon :notebook:. You can find your first video below:

## This is your training

It is beneficial that you take advantage of the resources presented to you, but I would also recommend that if you find instances where things can be improved, then please create an issue in the original repository [here](https://github.com/github-campus-advisors/Campus-Advisor-Training/issues). If you are not familiar with issues in GitHub, no worries, you will learn about them soon.

## To Get Started

1. Register for an account on [github.com](https://github.com/).
2. [Download, install and configure git](https://git-scm.com/). Windows users please install [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/).
3. If you are new to Git, GitHub, and the command-line, I recommend [downloading ATOM](https://atom.io/), a text editor, which is available for Mac, Linux, and Windows. I will be using ATOM in all of the modules.

    #### Mac and Linux Setup
      If you are using a Mac or Linux machine, I would recommend following these instructions to setup the ATOM command-line:
      - [ATOM command-line Instructions](https://youtu.be/h5xcw8_8gaE)

    #### Chromebook User Setup
      If you are using a Chromebook, great news! You can use ATOM to follow along with the videos with some easy instructions:
      - [Instructions and setup for ATOM for Chromebook Users](https://blog.atom.io/2018/10/02/running-atom-on-chome-os.html)
      - [ATOM command-line Instructions](https://youtu.be/h5xcw8_8gaE)

    #### Windows User Setup
      If you are using Windows, and new to the command-line, I would recommend following additional instructions to avoid using the default shell, known as "PowerShell," in ATOM since all of the examples in the modules will be using a Unix based shell:
      - [Instructions and setup for using ATOM in Windows](https://youtu.be/0aVAjhVZ9Ko)
    
4. Make sure to set Git with your name and email address using the following commands on the command-line with your name and email address:
```
$ git config --global user.name "FirstName LastName"
$ git config --global user.email "email@example.com"
```
This is important because Git will use this information when you work on a project.

## Questions
If you have any questions regarding setup or on any of the learning modules, I would recommend visiting the [GitHub Education Community](https://education.github.community/c/teachers/advisors) for assistance.
