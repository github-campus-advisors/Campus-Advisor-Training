## When you are finished

Once you have completed the training, you’re free to end there with your new knowledge. Or, after you have spent some using GitHub in your classroom, you may want to consider becoming a GitHub Campus Advisor.

- Be invited to participate in GitHub Education sponsored conferences

A Campus Advisor applicant should:
- Be comfortable using Git and GitHub
- Have had a GitHub account for at least six months
- Be a classroom teacher who teaches students
