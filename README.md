# Welcome to Campus Advisor Training

## To Get Started

1. Register for an account on [github.com](https://github.com/).
2. [Download, install and configure git](https://git-scm.com/). Windows users please install [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/).
3. If you are new to Git, GitHub, and the command-line, I recommend [downloading ATOM](https://atom.io/), a text editor, which is available for Mac, Linux, and Windows. I will be using ATOM in all of the modules.

    #### Mac and Linux Setup
      If you are using a Mac or Linux machine, I would recommend following these instructions to setup the ATOM command-line:

    #### Chromebook User Setup
      If you are using a Chromebook, great news! You can use ATOM to follow along with the videos with some easy instructions:
      - [Instructions and setup for ATOM for Chromebook Users](https://blog.atom.io/2018/10/02/running-atom-on-chome-os.html)
      - [ATOM command-line Instructions](https://youtu.be/h5xcw8_8gaE)

    #### Windows User Setup
      If you are using Windows, and new to the command-line, I would recommend following additional instructions to avoid using the default shell, known as "PowerShell," in ATOM since all of the examples in the modules will be using a Unix based shell:
      - [Instructions and setup for using ATOM in Windows](https://youtu.be/0aVAjhVZ9Ko)
    
4. Make sure to set Git with your name and email address using the following commands on the command-line with your name and email address:
```
$ git config --global user.name "FirstName LastName"
$ git config --global user.email "email@example.com"
```
This is important because Git will use this information when you work on a project.

## Questions
If you have any questions regarding setup or on any of the learning modules, I would recommend visiting the [GitHub Education Community](https://education.github.community/c/teachers/advisors) for assistance.
